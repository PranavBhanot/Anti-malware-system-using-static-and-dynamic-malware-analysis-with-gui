Introduction
The Malware Detection and Prevention Application is a Python-based desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that helps users detect and prevent malware on their systems. This application leverages various malware detection techniques to identify potentially malicious files and provides options to quarantine or remove them from the system.

Features
User-Friendly GUI: The application offers an intuitive graphical interface, making it easy for users to navigate and utilize its features without extensive technical knowledge.

Malware Scanning: Users can initiate scans on specific files, directories, or the entire system to search for potential malware. The application employs signature-based and behavior-based detection methods.

Quarantine: Detected malware can be isolated and moved to a quarantine folder, preventing it from causing harm to the system or spreading further.

Real-Time Protection: The application can run in the background, providing real-time monitoring of files and network activities, promptly detecting and blocking suspicious behavior.

Updateable Definitions: The application's malware database and detection algorithms can be regularly updated to stay current and effective against new threats.

Logs and Reports: Detailed logs of scans, detections, and preventive actions are maintained. Users can review these logs and generate reports for further analysis.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
PyQt (for GUI)
Malware detection libraries (e.g., ClamAV, YARA)
Internet connection (for updates and real-time protection)
All dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.
