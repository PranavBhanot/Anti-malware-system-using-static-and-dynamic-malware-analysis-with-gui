Features
User-Friendly GUI: The application offers an intuitive graphical interface, making it easy for users to navigate and utilize its features without extensive technical knowledge.

Malware Scanning: Users can initiate scans on specific files, directories, or the entire system to search for potential malware. The application employs signature-based and behavior-based detection methods.

Quarantine: Detected malware can be isolated and moved to a quarantine folder, preventing it from causing harm to the system or spreading further.

Real-Time Protection: The application can run in the background, providing real-time monitoring of files and network activities, promptly detecting and blocking suspicious behavior.

Updateable Definitions: The application's malware database and detection algorithms can be regularly updated to stay current and effective against new threats.

Logs and Reports: Detailed logs of scans, detections, and preventive actions are maintained. Users can review these logs and generate reports for further analysis.
