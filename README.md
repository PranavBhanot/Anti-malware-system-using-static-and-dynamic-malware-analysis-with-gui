# MALWARE DETECTION AND PREVENTION APPLICATION WITH GUI
The Malware Detection and Prevention Application is a Python-based desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that helps users detect and prevent malware on their systems. This application leverages various malware detection techniques to identify potentially malicious files and provides options to quarantine or remove them from the system.

## STATIC AND DYNAMIC ANALYSIS

Scanning a File for Malware:

The code has a function that takes a file path and an API key as input.
It sends the specified file to the VirusTotal API to check if it contains malware or suspicious content.
The API responds with a scan ID (resource) that identifies this specific scan request.
Retrieving Scan Report:

Another function takes the scan ID (resource) and the same API key as input.
It queries the VirusTotal API to retrieve the scan report for the previously submitted file.
The report includes information from various antivirus engines about whether they detected any issues in the file.
Main Execution:

In the main part of the script, a file path and API key are specified.
The script calls the scanning function to initiate a scan and get the scan ID (resource).
It then uses this scan ID to fetch the scan report from the API.
Finally, it prints out the results, indicating which antivirus engines detected issues in the scanned file.
In essence, this code allows you to check if a file is potentially harmful or contains malware by utilizing the VirusTotal service, which aggregates results from multiple antivirus engines to provide a comprehensive analysis.

## MODEL FUNCTIONS
Importing Libraries:

The code imports necessary libraries from scikit-learn, including tree for decision tree classification and DictVectorizer for data transformation.
Initialization:

It initializes a decision tree classifier (classifier) and a vectorizer (vectorizer).
Toy Training Data:

Defines some toy training examples and their corresponding ground truth labels.
Vectorization:

Prepares the vectorizer by fitting it to the training examples to understand the feature structure.
Converts the training examples into a numerical matrix (X) suitable for machine learning and assigns the ground truth labels to y.
Training the Classifier:

Trains the decision tree classifier using the transformed training data (X and y).
Testing:

Creates a test example and converts it into the same numerical format using the vectorizer.
Uses the trained classifier to predict the label for the test example and prints the result.
Visualization:

Exports the decision tree structure to a DOT file ("classifier.dot").
Converts the DOT file into a PNG image ("classifier.png") using the dot command-line tool.

## EMAIL SPAM DETECTOR 
Imported Libraries:

The code imports several libraries, including math, re, urllib.parse, socket, pyquery, requests, json, string, and numpy.
Class Initialization:

The LexicalURLFeature class is initialized with a URL as an input parameter.
The class sets attributes like description, url, urlparse (parsed URL components), and host (IP address of the host).
Private Methods:

__get_entropy(self, text): Calculates the entropy of a given text. Entropy measures the randomness or unpredictability of characters in the text.
__get_ip(self): Tries to obtain the IP address of the URL's host. If the host is an IP address itself, it returns that IP; otherwise, it attempts to resolve the host to an IP address using gethostbyname.
Lexical Feature Extraction Methods:

These methods extract various lexical features from the URL:
url_scheme(): Returns the scheme (e.g., "http" or "https") of the URL.
url_length(): Returns the length of the URL.
url_path_length(): Returns the length of the URL path.
url_host_length(): Returns the length of the URL's network location (hostname or IP).
url_host_is_ip(): Checks if the URL's host is an IP address.
url_has_port_in_string(): Checks if the URL has a port number specified in the string.
number_of_digits(): Counts the number of digits in the URL.
number_of_parameters(): Counts the number of URL parameters.
number_of_fragments(): Counts the number of URL fragments (e.g., anchors).
is_encoded(): Checks if the URL is URL-encoded.
num_encoded_char(): Counts the number of URL-encoded characters.
url_string_entropy(): Calculates the entropy of the URL string.
number_of_subdirectories(): Counts the number of subdirectories in the URL path.
number_of_periods(): Counts the number of periods (dots) in the URL.
has_client_in_string(): Checks if the string 'client' is present in the URL.
has_admin_in_string(): Checks if the string 'admin' is present in the URL.
has_server_in_string(): Checks if the string 'server' is present in the URL.
has_login_in_string(): Checks if the string 'login' is present in the URL.
get_tld(self) Method:

Returns the top-level domain (TLD) of the URL (e.g., "com", "org", "net") by splitting the network location and handling possible port specification.
This class allows you to extract a variety of features from a given URL, which can be useful for tasks like URL classification or analysis.

## FEATURES
User-Friendly GUI: The application offers an intuitive graphical interface, making it easy for users to navigate and utilize its features without extensive technical knowledge.

Malware Scanning: Users can initiate scans on specific files, directories, or the entire system to search for potential malware. The application employs signature-based and behavior-based detection methods.

Quarantine: Detected malware can be isolated and moved to a quarantine folder, preventing it from causing harm to the system or spreading further.

Real-Time Protection: The application can run in the background, providing real-time monitoring of files and network activities, promptly detecting and blocking suspicious behavior.

Updateable Definitions: The application's malware database and detection algorithms can be regularly updated to stay current and effective against new threats.

Logs and Reports: Detailed logs of scans, detections, and preventive actions are maintained. Users can review these logs and generate reports for further analysis.
